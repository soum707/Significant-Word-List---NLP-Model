Go, get outta here.

Go!

They say the higher

you aim,

the farther

you fall.

F*** you, Eddie Kim.

And look at you now,

Mr. Prosecutor, huh?

Not so high

and mighty anymore.

Well, that's

a noble gesture.

I'll make sure

to tell your son

all about it.

The reason he gets

to grow up without a father

is because of how

goddamn noble he was.

Then again, I was raised

by a single mom and...

I didn't turn out

so bad, huh? Whoo!

Clean this up.

I'm going back to LA.

Let's get the hell out

of here...

and find that guy!

This is Mi Jung Lee

reporting live

from the Kaena Point area.

Details remain sketchy in

the brutal slaying yesterday

of Los Angeles prosecutor

Daniel Hayes,

who was vacationing

in Hawaii.

Hayes has been

in the news lately

for his high-profile pursuit of reputed

mobster Edward Kim.

Mr. Kim's representatives

have issued a statement

of condolences

to the Hayes family

and claim absolutely

no involvement

in what they call

a hideous act

of violence.

The ongoing saga

in the criminal

investigation

of Mr. Kim involves charges

of murder, racketeering

and police corruption

at the highest levels,

both here in Hawaii

and on the mainland.

Thank you, Mi Jung.

We'll be sure to check in

for any updates

as they become

available.

Do as I say,

and you live.

Stay flat against this wall.

Don't even breathe.

Go go go, that way!

Black car, go!

What the hell is going on?

You witnessed a murder

and didn't tell anybody.

Why didn't you call

the police?

The news said they were corrupt,

so I figured they'd be in on it.

Smart kid.

Who are you?

I'm Agent

Neville Flynn, FBI.

Pleased

to meet you, Sean.

I gotta tell you, Sean, I'm getting

a little tired of all this garbage

you've been feeding me.

We know you were there.

Your prints are all over it,

so stop insulting

my intelligence.

You witnessed a murder.

You have a responsibility.

Look here, Sean.

I've been doing this for a while,

so I know all kinds

of neat little

interrogation tricks.

You know, good cop

bad cop,

reverse psychology,

stare-down contests, threats.

You name it,

I've done it.

But why don't we

leapfrog all that bullshit,

save ourselves a lot

of aggravation and time,

of which there is

close to zero,

and I tell you

the truth?

Truth is I'm not

worried about you

if you testify.

But I am worried

about you if you don't.

What-- what if I didn't see him clearly?

I mean, I wouldn't be--

What did I just tell you about saving us

aggravation and time?

He knows who you are!

That's why those people

were at your house trying to kill you.

And make no mistake,

Eddie Kim will kill you,

if you let him.

Last week I was planning

a surfing trip to Bali.

Now...

now you make it sound

like I have no choice--

Oh, no no no no no no no no no.

You got choices.

You got tons

of choices,

but there's only one

correct choice:

Come with us to LA,

testify against his ass,

put him in jail

for life.

Tell you what:

You sit here,

think about it.

You let us know

what you decide.

We'll be outside.

The white zone is for

immediate in-loading

and unloading

of passengers only.

So you got any requests

for your final flight?

Well, just what

any flight attendant wants.

Low-maintenance

passengers.

Uh-huh, that would

be very nice.

A'ite, ladies.

Hey, Troy, Leroy, I got this, all right?

Let me sign 'em for them.

Let me sign 'em for them.

Gimme that marker, son.

How you doing, sweetie?

You all right? There you go.

You take care, baby.

All right.

- Can I get your autograph?

- You can get a little more than that.

Yeah, no doubt. Let me do this on

the special for you right there.

- Mmm, yeah. Mm-hmm.

- It tickles.

Mmm!

- Take care, all right.

- All right.

- Will you sign this, please?

- Oh yeah, no doubt, little man.

Here we go.

- Mm, there you go.

- Thank you.

- Hey, yo, stay black.

- Hells, yeah.

All right.

All right, y'all, God bless you.

I gotta get out of here

and catch this flight, all right?

Y'all take care. Catch the next album.

- We can't wait!

- Yeah, all right, no doubt.

All right, look, we gotta make sure

we got some more of this, all right?

- Look at the Howard Hughes of rap.

- What?

What was that?

He-- he said,

man, can you believe this crap?

- Man, this is crap right here.

- Hey, yo, come on, y'all.

Y'all messing with t-shirts and hats.

Y'all are supposed to be

watching my back, son.

- Come on.

- You're right, brother, I got you.

Ladies and gentlemen,

South Pacific Air flight 121

- has been delayed half an hour.

- Oh, come on!

We apologize

for this inconvenience

and we'll begin boarding

as soon as possible.

Oh, boy.

It's gonna be a fun flight.

Aloha all Island

Express passengers...

Five whole hours.

Do you know who's working today?

I didn't get a crew list.

You know,

I have no idea.

Oh my God.

Here she comes. Here she comes!

- Surprise!

- Surprise!

Oh!

Oh, Claire, don't go.

Last thing the world

needs is another lawyer.

I mean, really,

how could you leave all this?

- It's gonna be hard.

- Will you take me with you?

Please.

Could we ask for Bruno

from Simply Corporate?

Elena, by we,

I mean you.

No, not all drivers are the same.

That's the point.

The last thing I need is some guy

going on and on

about the weather

the whole way home. Get Bruno.

Mary Kate, hush.

Sorry, she gets

nervous flying.

Oh, that's okay.

I understand,

you know.

Do you think she'll

want some Xanax?

Oh no, she's okay.

How you feeling?

Yeah, fine.

You ready for this?

Yeah.

Is that our plane?

No, every cop in Honolulu

thinks it is.

Hey, come on, relax.

FBI's escorting

some guy to LA.

They just took over

all first class.

Are they allowed

to do that?

Well, apparently

FAA Section 108 states,

"If deemed necessary,

they can do whatever they want."

Well, who's gonna tell the first class

passengers they're flying coach?

That would be you, kid.

South Pacific Air 121.

Oh, my.

I was hoping you'd
